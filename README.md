# News App

## Overview

This News App is a feature-rich web application built with React. It offers real-time news updates by fetching data from a remote API source, thanks to the power of React's useState hook. The app includes a responsive navigation bar and intuitive logic for disabling buttons when there are no more news articles to display.

## Features

- **Fetching News from API**: The heart of this app is its ability to retrieve current news articles from an external API source, ensuring users always have access to the latest news.

- **React Development**: The entire application is developed using React, a versatile JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, providing efficient state management and dynamic rendering capabilities.

- **useState Hook for Dynamic Rendering**: The useState hook is employed to manage dynamic rendering, making the user interface responsive to changes in news data.

- **Responsive Navbar**: The app incorporates a responsive navigation bar, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Button State Logic**: We've implemented logic to disable buttons when there are no more news articles to display, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
